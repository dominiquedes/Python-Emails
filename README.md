# Python Emails
I often struggle with navigating through Gmail. I find it tiring to scroll through useless emails, and even though I can set filters, they're never fully effective. Therefore, I am working on my new big focus, the ultimate terminal Gmail assistant. I plan to do all of this in Python, and when it's all finished, I will attempt to make it into an application.

## Phase 1: Reading Emails
I first began my project in creating the ultimate terminal gmail assistant by first creating the email fetching component. I plan on using [simplegmail](https://github.com/jeremyephron/simplegmail/blob/master/simplegmail/query.py) for the Gmail proportion of the project; when learning to get the emails it proved to be easy and clear-cut on what to do. I used the queries provided to set the instructions for fetching my emails: starred and no older than six months. I experimented with the other parameters, but this was the most useful.
